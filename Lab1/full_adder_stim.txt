// Lines that start with two forward slashes are comments.
// The entries below are hex digits
// The underscore, _, between the digits is ignored - it's used as a spacer for clarity
// The left digit is the expected output: we'll just use the right 2 bits for {CRY,SUM}
// The right digit is the input value: we'll just use the rightmost 3 bits for {A,B,Cin}.
